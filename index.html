    <h2 class="text"><a id="one">What is Modding?</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">In most games, there is a beginning, middle, and end. However, this does not stop gamers from enjoying their game to the max. Through the use of custom software, or if the developer implements it; there are modders. A subgroup of the community that works towards acheiving the impossible. By adding custom innovations to their favorite games, whether that be bugfixes, or whole new features. The sky is the limit with modding.</p><p>

    </p><h2 class="text"><a id="two">What is a Mod Loader?</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">A mod loader is a type of software that allows the user to easily implement mods created by other users. This can be crucial for games, due to the fact that if you were to make a mod without it, you would have to directly edit the game's files, or if the game has an anti-cheat, make a bypass for the anti-cheat, thus making the game vulerable to hackers.</p>

    <h2 class="text"><a id="three">What is the FML Launcher?</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">The FML Launcher is a mod loader made for Minecraft, a popular 3D game, which has the unique look of a large 3D world, made up of pixelated blocks.

      FML stands for Forge Mod Loader, more commonely known as Forge. Forge is used to create a 'mods' folder in the Minecraft directory, where users can easily drag n' drop their mods in.</p>

    <h2 class="text"><a id="four">Is FML Outdated?</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">This topic is rather controversial, but I will try to explain it unbiased. FML was one of the oldest mod loaders in Minecraft, and it has went through the test of time over years the game has been out. However, there have been some concerns for later versions of the game, for messy coding, and performance issues. This has sparked a new community creating a new mod loader for the game. It's name is Fabric. Fabric has a numerade of benefits over Forge, however it has been raised that any mods made for Forge will not work on Fabric unless ported by the developer. Not only that, but Fabric is only made for newer versions of the game. This may seem good, but for PvP related gameplay, where it is very popular for users to play on an earlier version of the game.
      <img class="text" src="fabric.png" alt="Fabric Mod Loader">
      Not only is this affecting the PvP community, it is also affecting the modding community, as they used to rely on a much more stable, slimmed down version of the game. This is not to mention the good side of Fabric however. While Forge is used for older versions, Fabric is used on newer, more complicated versions of the game, bring another subgroup of modders to experiment with new features.</p>
