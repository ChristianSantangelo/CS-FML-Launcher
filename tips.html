    <h2 class="text"><a id="six">1). Allocate More RAM</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">When playing with a lot of mods, it is important to make sure that you have allocated more of your systems resources to help run and maintain a smooth FPS. Depending on the mods you are running, you should use 4-6GB of RAM allocated to Minecraft. Learn more about using JVM Arguments to increase your RAM Allocation, <a href="https://www.online-tech-tips.com/gaming/how-to-allocate-more-ram-to-minecraft/">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="text"><a id="seven">2). Use Performance Mods</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">Not only is RAM important to your gameplay, it is also important to use as less RAM as possible, while still running the game smoothly. This is important so if you were running big mods, you would still have room for other mods, and room for your computer to work on other programs in the background. Popular performance mods include Optifine, BetterFPS, and FoamFix for Forge. For Fabric, you would use Lithium, Sodium, Phospher, and Starlight.

      Keep in mind, that you will most likely get more FPS using Fabric performance mods.</p>

    <h2 class="text"><a id="eight">3). Organize Your Mods</a></h2>
    <p class="text1">If you are an avid modded player, you know the struggle of finding mod, which is why we try to put them in a place where we can find them. I personally have a 'mods' folder on my desktop for each modpack I have. However, if you use Forge, you can place folders within your mods folder, which can organize your mods for you. Keep in mind that this will only apply for versions.
